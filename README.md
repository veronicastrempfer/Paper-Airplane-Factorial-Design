# Paper Airplane Factorial Design

## Research Question 
How do different combinations of paper clip placements (nose, middle, rear) on a paper airplane influence its flight distance? 

## Methods
- Factorial design with three factors (nose, middle, rear)
- Sample size determined by power calculation

## Tools
- All analysis, calculations, and visualizations done in R

## Overall Findings
- Linear modeling suggested no significant effect of paper clip placement (nose, middle, rear) or their interactions on flight distance.
- Sample size limitation (10 reps per condition) reduced statistical power, preventing smaller effects from being observed.
- Variability was introduced by throwing technique, measurement precision, gradual deteriation of paper, and indoor space constraints, but assumptions for linear modeling were met.
